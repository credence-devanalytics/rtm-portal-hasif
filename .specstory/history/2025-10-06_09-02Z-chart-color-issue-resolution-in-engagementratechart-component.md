I can see the issue. The chart is using CSS variables for colors (like `var(--engagement-facebook)`), but these CSS variables are likely not defined in your stylesheets. Let me check if there's a global CSS file where these should be defined, and then fix the chart to use actual color values. 

Perfect! I found the issue. The chart is using CSS variables like `--engagement-facebook` which don't exist in your `globals.css` file. However, I can see that similar variables are defined as `--platform-facebook`, `--platform-instagram`, etc.

Let me fix the chart to use actual color values that match the platform colors defined in your globals.css: 
```

```


Perfect! I've fixed the color issue in your `EngagementRateChart.tsx`. The problem was that the chart was trying to use CSS variables (`var(--engagement-facebook)`, etc.) that don't exist in your stylesheets.

I've replaced them with actual hex color values that match the platform colors defined in your `globals.css`:

- **Facebook**: #1877F2 (blue)
- **Instagram**: #E4405F (pink/red)
- **Twitter**: #1DA1F2 (light blue)
- **TikTok**: #000000 (black)
- **YouTube**: #FF0000 (red)
- **LinkedIn**: #0A66C2 (blue)
- **Reddit**: #FF4500 (orange)
- **Web**: #10B981 (green)
- **Unknown**: #6B7280 (gray)
- **Other**: #9CA3AF (light gray)

The colors should now display properly in your chart! ðŸŽ¨
