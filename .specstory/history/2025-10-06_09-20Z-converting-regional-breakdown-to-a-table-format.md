I'll help you convert the Regional Distribution chart into a table format with regions as column headers and viewership data. 
```

```


I've successfully converted the Regional Distribution from a bar chart into a table format with the following features:

✅ **Regions as column headers** - Each region is displayed as a column header
✅ **Viewership data** - Shows total viewers for each region
✅ **Two rows**:
   - **Total Viewers**: Raw numbers with comma formatting
   - **Formatted**: Abbreviated format (K for thousands, M for millions)
✅ **Styled table**: Purple theme matching the original card design with hover effects

The table now displays horizontally with regions across the top and makes it easy to compare viewership numbers across different geographic regions at a glance.

make the table vertical and if theres not enough space, split it into 2 tables left and right

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll help you make the table vertical (regions as rows instead of columns) and split it into two tables side by side if there are too many regions. 
```

```


Perfect! I've successfully converted the Regional Distribution table to a vertical layout with the following features:

✅ **Vertical Table Layout**:
   - Regions are now displayed as rows (not columns)
   - Each row shows: Region, Total Viewers, and Formatted value
   - Headers: "Region", "Total Viewers", "Formatted"

✅ **Smart Splitting Logic**:
   - If there are **more than 3 regions**, the table automatically splits into 2 side-by-side tables
   - Left table shows the first half of regions
   - Right table shows the second half of regions
   - If 3 or fewer regions, displays as a single table

✅ **Responsive Grid**:
   - Uses CSS Grid with `grid-cols-2` when split
   - Uses `grid-cols-1` for single table
   - Gap between tables for better spacing

✅ **Consistent Styling**:
   - Maintains the purple theme
   - Hover effects on rows
   - Right-aligned numbers for better readability
   - Same formatting (M for millions, K for thousands)

The table will now be much easier to read and won't overflow horizontally, with the smart split ensuring it fits well in the available space!
