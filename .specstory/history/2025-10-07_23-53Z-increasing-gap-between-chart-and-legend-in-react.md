# Increasing gap between chart and legend in React (2025-10-07 23:53Z)

_**User (2025-10-08 00:09Z)**_

is there a way to increase the gap between the chart and the  legend?

Looking at your code, yes! You can increase the gap between the chart and the legend by adjusting the `wrapperStyle` prop on the `Legend` component or by adding margin to the legend container.

Here are a couple of approaches:

**Option 1: Use `wrapperStyle` on the Legend component (Recommended)** 
```

```


I've added `wrapperStyle={{ marginTop: '30px' }}` to the Legend component. This will add a 30-pixel gap between the chart and the legend. You can adjust this value:
- Increase it (e.g., `'40px'`, `'50px'`) for more space
- Decrease it (e.g., `'20px'`, `'15px'`) for less space

The legend already has `mt-4` class in the CustomLegend component, but since you're using a custom content renderer, the `wrapperStyle` prop gives you direct control over the Legend's positioning within the chart.

Let me check the current state of the file to see what might be happening: 

I see you've increased it to 80px. The issue is that the `ResponsiveContainer` has a fixed height of 400px, which limits the total space. Try **increasing the ResponsiveContainer height** to accommodate the extra gap: 
```

```


I've increased the `ResponsiveContainer` height from 400 to 500. This gives more room for the chart and the gap. Now your `marginTop: "80px"` on the Legend should be more visible. You can adjust both values:

- **ResponsiveContainer height**: Controls the total space (try 450, 500, 550, etc.)
- **Legend wrapperStyle marginTop**: Controls the gap between chart and legend (try "40px", "60px", "80px", etc.)

The combination of both will give you the spacing you want!
