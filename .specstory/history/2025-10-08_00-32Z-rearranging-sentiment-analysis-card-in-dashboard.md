# Rearranging sentiment analysis card in dashboard (2025-10-08 00:32Z)

_**User (2025-10-08 00:34Z)**_

i want to move the sentiment analysis card to the top same as the total posts, total reach, and total total interactions card. and then i want to remove the sentiment distribution card

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll help you move the sentiment analysis card to the top with the metrics cards and remove the sentiment distribution card.

Let me first read the MetricsCards component to understand its structure: 

Now let me read the SentimentCard component to understand its structure: 

Perfect! Now I'll:
1. Modify the MetricsCards component to include the sentiment analysis as a 4th card
2. Remove the sentiment distribution pie chart from the dashboard page

Let me first update the MetricsCards component to make it a 4-column grid and add the sentiment analysis: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```


Now let me update the dashboard page to:
1. Pass the `onFilterClick` prop to MetricsCards
2. Remove the entire grid section that contains the old sentiment card and pie chart 
```

```


Now we also need to remove the unused imports from the dashboard page since we're no longer using `SentimentCard` and `SentimentPieChart`: 
```

```


Perfect! I've successfully made the changes you requested:

## Summary of Changes:

### 1. **Updated MetricsCards Component** (`metrics-cards.jsx`):
   - Changed the grid from 3 columns to 4 columns (`md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`)
   - Added imports for sentiment icons (`Smile`, `Frown`, `Meh`) and the `cn` utility
   - Added sentiment data processing and filtering logic
   - Added a 4th card for "Sentiment Analysis" with:
     - Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiment breakdown
     - Click-to-filter functionality
     - Visual feedback for active filters
     - Compact display showing counts and percentages

### 2. **Updated Dashboard Page** (`page.jsx`):
   - Removed the imports for `SentimentCard` and `SentimentPieChart` (no longer needed)
   - Updated the `MetricsCards` component call to:
     - Use `mentionsData` instead of `metricsData` (to get sentiment data)
     - Pass the `onFilterClick` handler for interactive filtering
   - Removed the entire "Main Dashboard Grid" section that contained:
     - The standalone Sentiment Analysis card
     - The Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart

Now your dashboard will have:
- **Top Row**: 4 metric cards (Total Posts, Total Reach, Total Interactions, and Sentiment Analysis)
- The Sentiment Analysis card is compact and clickable for filtering
- The pie chart is removed
- All other charts remain in their original positions

The sentiment filtering functionality is preserved - users can still click on sentiment values to filter the dashboard data.

_**User (2025-10-08 00:36Z)**_

the numbers are all gone now

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Let me check the current state of the `metrics-cards.jsx` file to see what went wrong: 

The code looks correct. The issue is that we're now passing `mentionsData` to the MetricsCards component, but the metrics data (totalPosts, totalReach, totalInteractions) comes from a different API endpoint (`metricsData`). We need to pass both datasets. Let me check the dashboard page and fix it: 

I see the issue. The MetricsCards component needs both the metrics data (for posts, reach, interactions) and the mentions data (for sentiment). Let me update the MetricsCards component to accept both: 
```

```

```

```


Now let me update the dashboard page to pass both datasets: 
```

```


Perfect! Now the MetricsCards component will receive both:
- `data` (mentionsData) - which contains the sentiment information (positive, negative, neutral)
- `metricsData` - which contains the metrics information (totalPosts, totalReach, totalInteractions)

The component will now show all the numbers correctly:
1. **Total Posts** - from metricsData
2. **Total Reach** - from metricsData  
3. **Total Interactions** - from metricsData
4. **Sentiment Analysis** - from mentionsData (positive, negative, neutral counts)

The numbers should now all be visible! The component will use metricsData for the first three cards and mentionsData for the sentiment card.

_**User (2025-10-08 00:39Z)**_

the cross filtering is not wokring for the sentiment card

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Let me check how the filtering is being handled. The issue is likely in how we're calling the `onFilterClick` function. Let me examine the current implementation: 

I can see the `handleChartClick` function expects two arguments when called with strings (type and value). The issue is in the MetricsCards component - it's calling `onFilterClick` correctly, but let me verify the exact signature. Let me check the current metrics-cards implementation: 

The function looks correct. Let me check if there's a console error or test the actual click handler. Let me also verify the sentiment values being passed are correct. Let me look at the actual click implementation in the JSX: 

The code looks correct. Let me add some debugging and also check if the issue is that the filtering logic might need to handle the case where `onFilterClick` is not properly receiving both arguments. Let me update the metrics-cards component to add some debugging: 
```

```


Now let me also check how the old SentimentCard was calling the filter - let me look at that file again to compare: 

The code is identical. Now let me check if there's a difference in how the handleChartClick function processes the arguments. Let me look more carefully at the dashboard's handleChartClick: 

Ah! I see the issue. The `handleChartClick` function uses `arguments[0]` and `arguments[1]` to get the two parameters. However, this won't work properly in some cases. The function signature expects `clickData` as the first parameter, but when called with two arguments like `onFilterClick("sentiment", "positive")`, it's trying to use the `arguments` object which might not work as expected in all contexts.

Let me fix the `handleChartClick` function to properly handle both the old two-parameter style and the new object-based style: 
```

```


Perfect! Now the `handleChartClick` function properly accepts two parameters: `clickDataOrType` and `value`. This will correctly handle calls like:
- `onFilterClick("sentiment", "positive")` - Two parameters
- `onFilterClick({ type: "topic-sentiment", topic: "..." })` - Object-based

The filtering should now work properly when you click on the sentiment items in the MetricsCards component!

_**User (2025-10-08 00:48Z)**_

make the gap between the senitment smaller and then move the percentege next to the number of sentiment and remove the tips

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll update the MetricsCards component to make the sentiment items more compact by:
1. Reducing the gap between sentiment items
2. Moving the percentage next to the number (inline)
3. Removing the "Click to filter by sentiment" tip at the bottom 
```

```


Perfect! I've made the following changes to the Sentiment Analysis card in the MetricsCards component:

1. **Reduced gap between sentiments**: Changed `space-y-2` to `space-y-1` for tighter spacing
2. **Moved percentage next to the number**: The percentage now appears inline next to the count like "123 (45%)" instead of being on a separate line
3. **Removed the tip**: Deleted the "Click to filter by sentiment" text at the bottom

The sentiment card is now more compact and cleaner while still maintaining all its functionality!

---

_**User (2025-10-08 00:58Z)**_

make the sentiment and its values flex col, and then position those sentiments in flex row

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll update the layout so each sentiment item displays in a column (label on top, value below), and arrange all three sentiments in a row: 
```

```


Perfect! I've restructured the sentiment card layout:

**Changes made:**
1. **Container**: Changed from `space-y-1` (vertical stacking) to `flex gap-2 justify-between` (horizontal row layout)
2. **Each sentiment item**: Now uses `flex flex-col items-center` to display content vertically (icon + label on top, values below)
3. **Added `flex-1`**: Each sentiment item takes equal width
4. **Centered alignment**: Items are centered both horizontally and within each column
5. **Separated number and percentage**: Number on one line, percentage on the next line for better readability

Now the three sentiments (Positive, Negative, Neutral) are displayed side-by-side in a row, with each one showing its icon/label at the top and the count/percentage values stacked below.

_**User (2025-10-08 01:40Z)**_

i want to add a new chart similar to the chart given in the context 

but change the table to mentions_classify_public

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll help you create a new engagement rate chart similar to the one in the context, but using the `mentions_classify_public` table. Let me first check the current structure and then create the necessary files. 

Let me check one of the existing API routes to understand the structure: 

Now let me check the schema to understand the table structure: 

Perfect! I can see the table has `engagementrate`, `reach`, `interaction`, and `type` (platform) fields. Now I'll create the engagement rate chart component and API route.

First, let me create the API route for engagement rate: 

Now let me create the EngagementRateChart component: 

Now let me update the dashboard page to include this new chart. First, let me check the current state: 
```

```

```

```


Now let me add the fetch function for engagement rate data: 
```

```


Now let me add the query for engagement rate data: 
```

```


Now let me update the isLoading check and add the chart to the page: 
```

```


Now let me add the EngagementRateChart component to the dashboard. Let me find where the other charts are positioned: 
```

```


Perfect! I've successfully created a new Engagement Rate chart similar to the one in the context. Here's what I've added:

## Summary of Changes:

### 1. **Created API Route** (`route.js`):
   - Fetches data from `mentions_classify_public` table
   - Retrieves `engagementrate`, `reach`, `interaction`, and `type` (platform) fields
   - Supports the same filtering as other endpoints (date range, sentiments, sources)
   - Includes fallback data if database is unavailable

### 2. **Created EngagementRateChart Component** (`engagement-rate-chart.jsx`):
   - Bar chart showing average engagement rate per platform
   - Color-coded platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
   - Interactive filtering - click on any platform to filter the dashboard
   - Hover effects for better UX
   - Custom tooltip showing:
     - Average Engagement Rate
     - Total Mentions
     - Total Reach
     - Total Interactions
   - Summary stats at the bottom showing:
     - Number of platforms
     - Average engagement across all platforms
     - Top performing platform
   - Visual feedback for active filters

### 3. **Integrated into Dashboard** (`page.jsx`):
   - Added import for the new component
   - Added query key and fetch function
   - Added React Query hook for data fetching
   - Positioned the chart after the Sentiment by Topics chart
   - Connected to the existing filter system

The chart is fully integrated with your existing dashboard's cross-filtering system, so clicking on a platform in this chart will filter all other charts, and vice versa!

---

_**User (2025-10-08 01:52Z)**_

the chart is supposed to be engagement rate over time where
the bar chart is the number of posts and the line chart is supposed to show reach rend and engagement trend

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I understand! You want an engagement rate chart that shows data over time (timeline), with:
- Bar chart: Number of posts per time period
- Line charts: Trends for reach, engagement rate over time

Let me update the component and API to reflect this: 
```

```


Now let me completely rewrite the chart component to show a combo chart with bars for post count and lines for reach and engagement trends: 
```

```


Perfect! I've completely rewritten both the API and the chart component. Now the chart shows:

## Updated Engagement Rate Over Time Chart:

### **API Changes** (`route.js`):
- Groups data by **date** (instead of platform)
- Returns for each date:
  - **Post Count**: Number of posts on that day
  - **Average Engagement Rate**: Average engagement % for that day
  - **Total Reach**: Sum of reach for all posts that day
  - **Total Interactions**: Sum of interactions for all posts that day

### **Chart Component** (`engagement-rate-chart.jsx`):
Now displays a **ComposedChart** with:

1. **Bar Chart (Blue)** - Shows the number of posts per day on the left Y-axis
2. **Line Chart (Green)** - Shows engagement rate trend on the right Y-axis
3. **Line Chart (Orange)** - Shows total reach trend on the right Y-axis (hidden if all values are 0)

### **Features**:
- **Dual Y-axis**: Left axis for post count, right axis for engagement rate percentage
- **Time-based X-axis**: Shows dates with formatted labels (e.g., "Jan 5")
- **Interactive tooltip**: Shows all metrics when hovering over any point
- **Summary stats at bottom**: Total posts, average engagement rate, and total reach
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Loading and empty states**: Proper handling of different data states

The chart now properly visualizes engagement trends over time, making it easy to see correlations between post volume, reach, and engagement rates!

---

_**User (2025-10-08 02:05Z)**_

why is it showing invalid date

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

The "Invalid Date" error is likely happening because the date format from the database might not be compatible with JavaScript's `Date` constructor. Let me fix the date formatting in the chart component: 
```

```


Now let me also add better debugging and data processing to handle the data format from the database: 
```

```


Now let me also update the API route to ensure the date is returned in a proper format: 
```

```


Perfect! I've made several improvements to fix the "Invalid Date" issue:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Chart Component** - Better Date Handling:
   - Added try-catch error handling for date parsing
   - Added validation to check if the date is valid using `isNaN(date.getTime())`
   - Returns the original string if parsing fails
   - Added console logging to debug data issues

### 2. **Chart Component** - More Flexible Data Processing:
   - Now handles multiple possible field name variations (lowercase, camelCase, snake_case)
   - Looks for `date`, `Date`, or `inserttime` fields
   - Logs both raw and processed data to the console for debugging

### 3. **API Route** - Better Data Formatting:
   - Explicitly formats the data after fetching from the database
   - Ensures all numeric values are properly parsed
   - Logs sample data to help identify any issues
   - PostgreSQL's `DATE()` function should return dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format which is valid for JavaScript

The chart should now properly handle dates and display them correctly. If you still see "Invalid Date", check your browser console - the new logging will show you exactly what data format is being received from the API, which will help us fix any remaining issues!

---

_**User (2025-10-08 02:07Z)**_

it was supposed to be a combo chart

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

You're right! I used `ComposedChart` which is the correct component for combo charts. Let me check if there's an issue with how I'm importing it. The chart should show both bars and lines together. Let me verify the import statement: 

The imports look correct. Let me check if the issue is with how the Reach line is being displayed. The problem might be that the reach values are too large compared to the engagement rate. Let me fix this by creating a normalized reach value or using a third Y-axis: 

I see the issue - the Reach line is trying to use the same Y-axis as the Engagement Rate, but reach values are typically in thousands or millions while engagement rate is a percentage (0-100). This makes the reach line invisible or breaks the chart. Let me fix this by creating a normalized reach metric or removing it and just showing engagement rate trend: 
```

```

```

```


Now let me also update the tooltip to show the reach trend value correctly: 
```

```


Perfect! I've fixed the combo chart to properly display all three metrics:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Normalized Reach Values**:
   - Added `reachTrend` field that divides reach by 1000 to show "thousands"
   - This makes reach values comparable to engagement rate percentages on the same Y-axis

### 2. **Updated Y-Axis Label**:
   - Changed from "Engagement Rate (%)" to "Engagement Rate (%) / Reach (K)"
   - This clearly indicates the dual scale

### 3. **Enhanced Reach Line**:
   - Uses `reachTrend` (in thousands) instead of raw `totalReach` values
   - Added dashed line style (`strokeDasharray="5 5"`) to differentiate from engagement rate line
   - Removed the `hide` condition so it always shows

### 4. **Improved Tooltip**:
   - Fixed to show all metrics with proper colors
   - Shows Post Count (blue), Engagement Rate (green), and Total Reach (orange)
   - Displays actual reach numbers (not the normalized trend)

Now the combo chart properly displays:
- **Blue Bars**: Post count (left Y-axis)
- **Green Solid Line**: Engagement rate trend (right Y-axis, %)
- **Orange Dashed Line**: Reach trend (right Y-axis, in thousands)

This makes it easy to see correlations between posting volume, engagement, and reach over time!

---

_**User (2025-10-08 02:08Z)**_

maybe take only in a span of 1 month from today

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll update the API to only fetch data from the last month (30 days from today) by default: 
```

```


Perfect! Now the engagement rate chart will automatically show data from the last 30 days (1 month) by default. The API will:

1. Calculate the date range: 30 days ago to today
2. Use this as the default if no date filters are provided
3. Still respect any date filters from the dashboard's filter controls

This means:
- If the user selects a date range in the dashboard filters, it will use that
- If no date range is selected, it will default to the last 30 days
- This keeps the chart focused and performant by not loading too much historical data

The data will now be limited to a manageable 1-month window, making the trends easier to read and analyze!

---

_**User (2025-10-08 02:10Z)**_

why theres no entry from the chart

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Let me check the browser console to see what data is being returned. First, let me add some debugging to see what's happening: 

Let me add better error logging to the engagement rate query: 
```

```


Now let me also check if the issue might be with the date format in the SQL query. PostgreSQL might need a different approach. Let me update the API to be more robust: 
```

```


Now let me also make sure the date range filter is being applied correctly. The issue might be that the filter is checking if `dateRange.from` exists, but with our default values, it should always exist now. Let me verify the filter building logic: 

The filter logic looks good. Now let me check if perhaps the data doesn't exist in the database for the last 30 days. Let me also add a check to see what the actual query parameters are. Let me update the console logging in the API: 
```

```


Now, there might be an issue with timezone. Let me also check if perhaps we need to remove the timezone from the comparison. Let me update the date filter to be more flexible: 
```

```


Perfect! I've made several improvements to help diagnose and fix the "no entries" issue:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Better Date Filtering**:
   - Changed from timestamp comparison to date-only comparison using `DATE()` function
   - This avoids timezone issues and matches dates more reliably
   - Uses simple `>=` and `<=` operators instead of `gte`/`lte` with full timestamps

### 2. **Improved SQL Type Casting**:
   - Added explicit type casts in the SELECT query (::int, ::float, ::bigint)
   - Used `TO_CHAR()` to format dates consistently as 'YYYY-MM-DD' strings

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Added logging to show the exact date range being queried
   - Shows first and last records when data is found
   - Warns when no data is found for the date range
   - Added React useEffect to log engagement data in the dashboard

### 4. **Better Ordering**:
   - Added explicit `ASC` to the ORDER BY clause

Now when you check the browser console, you should see:
- The date range being queried (e.g., "2025-09-08 to 2025-10-08")
- Number of records fetched
- First and last record samples
- Any warnings if no data is found

This will help us understand if:
- The data doesn't exist in that date range
- There's a date format mismatch
- The query is working but returning empty results

Check your browser console and let me know what you see!

---

_**User (2025-10-08 02:14Z)**_

reach trend should also in percentage

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll update the reach trend to be displayed as a percentage-based metric. Let me calculate the reach engagement rate (interactions/reach * 100) instead of just showing reach in thousands: 
```

```


Now let me update the Y-axis label and legend to reflect this change: 
```

```


Now let me update the tooltip to show the reach engagement rate as a percentage: 
```

```


Perfect! Now let me also update the chart description to reflect this change: 
```

```


Excellent! I've updated the chart so that the reach trend is now displayed as a percentage. Here's what changed:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Reach Trend Calculation**:
   - Changed from `reach / 1000` (thousands) to `(interactions / reach) * 100`
   - Now calculates **Reach Engagement Rate** = (Total Interactions / Total Reach) × 100%
   - This shows what percentage of people who saw the content actually engaged with it

### 2. **Updated Y-Axis Label**:
   - Changed from "Engagement Rate (%) / Reach (K)" to just "Engagement Rate (%)"
   - Now both lines use the same percentage scale

### 3. **Updated Legend**:
   - Green Line: "Avg Engagement Rate (%)" - average engagement from the database
   - Orange Dashed Line: "Reach Engagement Rate (%)" - calculated from interactions/reach

### 4. **Enhanced Tooltip**:
   - Shows "Avg Engagement" (green)
   - Shows "Reach Engagement" (orange) 
   - Both displayed as percentages
   - Added a separator and moved raw numbers (Total Reach and Total Interactions) to the bottom section

### 5. **Updated Description**:
   - Clarified that it shows "engagement rate trends" including reach-based engagement

Now the chart displays:
- **Blue Bars**: Number of posts per day
- **Green Solid Line**: Average engagement rate (%)
- **Orange Dashed Line**: Reach engagement rate (%) = how many people who saw it, engaged with it

Both percentage metrics are now on the same scale, making them easy to compare!

---

_**User (2025-10-08 02:17Z)**_

does the tool tip show the accurate numbers and %?

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Let me verify the tooltip calculations. The tooltip should show the exact values from the data. Let me check if we're displaying the correct numbers: 

The tooltip looks correct. It's pulling data directly from the `payload[0].payload` which contains the processed data. Let me verify the calculations are accurate by adding a console log to show what's being calculated: 
```

```


Now let me also verify the tooltip is showing accurate data. The tooltip should be displaying:

1. **Post Count** - Direct from data (accurate ✓)
2. **Avg Engagement Rate** - Direct from database, formatted to 2 decimals (accurate ✓)
3. **Reach Engagement** - Calculated as (interactions/reach * 100), formatted to 2 decimals (accurate ✓)
4. **Total Reach** - Direct from data, formatted with K/M notation (accurate ✓)
5. **Total Interactions** - Direct from data, formatted with K/M notation (accurate ✓)

The tooltip **is showing accurate numbers and percentages**. Here's what's being displayed:

- **Post Count**: Exact integer value
- **Avg Engagement**: Database value, rounded to 2 decimal places
- **Reach Engagement**: Calculated value `(totalInteractions / totalReach * 100)`, rounded to 2 decimal places
- **Total Reach & Interactions**: Exact values, just formatted for readability (e.g., 1.5K instead of 1500)

The console logs I added will help verify the calculations are correct. When you hover over a data point, you can:
1. Check the browser console to see the calculation breakdown
2. Verify the tooltip shows the same values

Is there a specific value that seems incorrect? If so, let me know and I can investigate further!

---

_**User (2025-10-08 02:19Z)**_

Cannot access 'formatted' before initialization



---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Ah, I see the issue! I'm trying to use `formatted.length` inside the map function before `formatted` is fully created. Let me fix that: 
```

```


Perfect! I've fixed the error by using a `isFirstItem` flag instead of checking `formatted.length` inside the map function. Now the code will:

1. Use a boolean flag `isFirstItem` initialized to `true`
2. Log the first item's details when processing it
3. Set the flag to `false` after logging
4. Continue processing the rest of the items without trying to access the `formatted` array before it's created

The error should be resolved now!

---

_**User (2025-10-08 02:22Z)**_

shouldnt it be in /100? why is it in small numbers? or im interpreting it wrong

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

You're absolutely right! The calculation is correct but the percentage value is very small (0.15%). Let me verify the math:

**From the tooltip:**
- Total Interactions: 11.0K = 11,000
- Total Reach: 7.4M = 7,400,000
- Reach Engagement: (11,000 / 7,400,000) × 100 = **0.148%** ✓

So the calculation is **correct**! The reach engagement rate is indeed very small (0.15%), which means:
- Out of 7.4 million people who saw the content, only 11,000 engaged with it
- That's a 0.15% engagement rate based on reach

This is actually realistic for social media:
- **Avg Engagement Rate (1.85%)** = engagement rate from the database (likely calculated as interactions/followers or another metric)
- **Reach Engagement Rate (0.15%)** = actual engagement from total reach (interactions/impressions)

The reach-based engagement is typically much lower than the average engagement rate because:
- **Avg Engagement** might be calculated from followers or a smaller base
- **Reach Engagement** is calculated from total impressions/views (much larger number)

**The numbers are correct!** This is showing you that while the average engagement rate is 1.85%, when you look at the total reach (impressions), only 0.15% of people who saw the content actually engaged with it.

Would you like me to:
1. Keep it as is (showing the true reach engagement rate)
2. Change the calculation to show a different metric
3. Add a note/explanation in the tooltip to clarify this?

---

_**User (2025-10-08 02:32Z)**_

i am trying to copy this style of chart

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

Ah! Now I understand! You want to normalize the reach and engagement trends to a 0-100% relative scale (like in the reference image) so they can be compared visually, rather than showing the actual percentage values. Let me update the chart to match this style: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```


Perfect! I've updated your chart to match the reference style. Here are the key changes:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Normalized Trends (0-100% Relative Scale)**
   - Both reach and engagement are now normalized to a 0-100% scale for visual comparison
   - This allows you to see the **patterns and trends** rather than absolute values
   - The calculation finds min/max values and scales everything proportionally

### 2. **Updated Chart Elements**
   - **Title**: "Engagement Over Time"
   - **Subtitle**: "Daily posts count with normalized reach and engagement trends (0-100% relative scale)"
   - **Right Y-Axis**: Changed from "Engagement Rate (%)" to "Relative Trend (%)" with domain [0, 100]
   - **Left Y-Axis**: Changed from "Post Count" to "Posts"

### 3. **Line Chart Names**
   - Orange dashed line: "Reach Trend" (normalized reach values)
   - Green solid line: "Engagement Trend" (normalized engagement/interaction values)
   - Blue bars: "Posts/Mentions"

### 4. **Updated Tooltip**
   - Shows actual values (not percentages)
   - "Posts/Mentions: X posts"
   - "Reach Trend: X.XM (reach)"
   - "Engagement Trend: X.XK (engagement)"
   - Includes note: "* Reach and engagement are shown as relative trends (0-100%)"

### 5. **Updated Summary Cards**
