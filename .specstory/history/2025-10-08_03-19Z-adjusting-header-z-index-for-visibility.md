# Adjusting header z-index for visibility (2025-10-08 03:19Z)

the header is at the back of the page, change its z axis

I'll help you fix the header's z-index so it appears in front of the page content. Let me first check the current Header component to see its styling. 

I can see the header already has `z-50` which should be quite high, but it seems the page content might have a higher z-index. Let me check the Multiplatform page to see what z-index values are being used there. 

I can see the issue! The header in the Multiplatform page has a `z-50` value in the sticky header section (line 1208), but it's conflicting with the Header component which also has `z-50`. Let me increase the z-index of the Header component to a higher value to ensure it stays on top. 
```

```


Perfect! I've increased the header's z-index from `z-50` to `z-[100]`. This will ensure the header appears above all other content on the page, including the sticky header section in the Multiplatform page which has `z-50`. The header should now be properly displayed in front of all page content.

add paddting top for the whole page because it is overlapping with the header

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll add padding to the top of the Multiplatform page to prevent content from overlapping with the header. Let me update the page: 
```

```


Perfect! I've made two changes to fix the overlapping issue:

1. **Added `pt-16`** (padding-top: 4rem/64px) to the main container div - This creates space at the top of the page to account for the fixed header
2. **Changed the sticky header from `top-0` to `top-16`** - This ensures the page's internal sticky header positions itself below the main navigation header

Now the page content will have proper spacing and won't be hidden behind the fixed header. The internal sticky section will also position correctly below the main header when scrolling.
