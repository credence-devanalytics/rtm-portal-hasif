I'll help you add padding to the top of the UnifiTV page to prevent the header from overlapping. Let me first check the current file structure. 

Now I'll add padding to the top of the page to prevent the header from overlapping. I can see the main container has `min-h-screen` but doesn't have top padding. I'll add `pt-` (padding-top) class to the main container. 
```

```


Perfect! I've added `pt-6` (padding-top of 1.5rem or 24px) to the main container div of the UnifiTV page. This will create space at the top of the page and prevent the header from overlapping with the content.

The change adds padding to the top of the page while keeping the header sticky. If you need more or less padding, you can adjust the value:
- `pt-4` = 16px (1rem) - smaller padding
- `pt-6` = 24px (1.5rem) - current setting
- `pt-8` = 32px (2rem) - more padding
- `pt-12` = 48px (3rem) - even more padding

The page should now display properly with the header not overlapping the top content.
