I'll help you change the PieChart into a ScatterChart. Let me modify the selected code: 
```

```


I've successfully changed the PieChart to a ScatterChart! The changes include:

1. **Replaced PieChart with ScatterChart** - Now shows data points in a scatter plot format
2. **Added X-axis** - Displays channel names categorically
3. **Added Y-axis** - Shows Total MAU with formatted values (K for thousands, M for millions)
4. **Added Z-axis** - Controls the size of the scatter points based on MAU values
5. **Added CartesianGrid** - Provides a grid background for better readability
6. **Added Legend** - Shows what the data represents
7. **Maintained the color coding** - Each channel still gets its unique color from the COLORS array

The scatter plot will now show each channel as a colored dot, with the position on the Y-axis representing its Total MAU value, making it easy to compare channel performance visually.
