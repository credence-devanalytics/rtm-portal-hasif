I'll help you apply the same theme to the Multiplatform page. First, let me check the theme styling from the SocMedAcc and Dashboard pages to understand the design pattern. 

Now let me check more of both files to see the background and container styling: 

Perfect! Now I can see the theme pattern. Let me check the main return section to see the background styling: 

Now I have enough information. The theme uses:
1. White background with subtle shadows for cards
2. Clean, minimal design with proper spacing
3. No gradient backgrounds on the main container
4. Consistent card styling with borders

Let me update the Multiplatform page to match this theme: 
```

```

```

```

```

```


Now let's update the PlatformCard component to match the theme - removing the excessive gradient backgrounds and backdrop blur effects: 

Let me be more specific by including more context from the MyTV special layout: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```


Perfect! Now I've successfully updated the Multiplatform page to match the theme from SocMedAcc and Dashboard pages. The changes include:

## Summary of Changes:

1. **Removed gradient background** - Changed from `bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 via-blue-50 to-indigo-50` to clean white background
2. **Simplified header** - Removed the separate header section with backdrop blur and made it consistent with other pages
3. **Updated layout** - Changed to `p-6 max-w-7xl mx-auto space-y-6` to match the standard layout
4. **Cleaned up cards** - Removed `backdrop-blur-sm`, `bg-white/80`, and `rounded-2xl` from cards, keeping just the standard Card component styling
5. **Updated spacing** - Changed gap from `gap-8` to `gap-6` to match other pages
6. **Simplified header title** - Removed gradient text effect, using standard bold text with `tracking-tight`
7. **Updated footer card** - Changed from custom styled div to standard Card component
8. **Consistent select styling** - Removed backdrop blur from select element

The page now has the same clean, professional theme as the SocMedAcc and Dashboard pages with:
- Clean white backgrounds
- Consistent spacing (gap-6)
- Standard card styling with borders
- No excessive gradients or blur effects
- Professional, minimal design

You're right! I need to add the Header component that's used in the other pages. Let me check what else might be missing and make the complete theme update. 

Now let me add the Header component import and update the page structure: 
```

```

```

```


Perfect! I've now added the `Header` component which is used in both SocMedAcc and Dashboard pages. The theme changes I made include:

## Complete Theme Updates Applied:

1. ✅ **Added Header component** - Now matches other pages with the navigation header
2. ✅ **Clean white background** - Removed gradient backgrounds (`bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 via-blue-50 to-indigo-50`)
3. ✅ **Standard layout** - Using `p-6 max-w-7xl mx-auto space-y-6`
4. ✅ **Simplified header section** - Removed separate sticky header with backdrop blur
5. ✅ **Standard card styling** - Removed `backdrop-blur-sm`, `bg-white/80`, and `rounded-2xl`
6. ✅ **Consistent spacing** - Changed from `gap-8` to `gap-6`
7. ✅ **Clean typography** - Using `tracking-tight` and `text-muted-foreground`
8. ✅ **Standard Card component** - Footer now uses Card instead of custom div
9. ✅ **Skeleton cards updated** - Removed backdrop blur from loading states

The page should now have the exact same clean, professional theme as SocMedAcc and Dashboard pages with the Header component at the top!

it looks the same tho dont you think?

You're absolutely right! Looking at the screenshot, the cards still have rounded borders and shadows. The theme from the other pages should have sharper, cleaner styling. Let me check what the actual card styling looks like in the SocMedAcc page: 

I see! The cards in SocMedAcc use empty className (`className=""`), meaning they're using the default Card component styling without any custom classes. The issue is that your current cards have custom border colors, rounded corners, shadows, and hover effects that make them look different. Let me remove all the custom styling to match the clean, minimal theme: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```


Now let me also update the inner card styling to remove the custom borders and make them cleaner. Let me remove the platform-specific background colors and borders from the inner metric cards: 
```

```

```

```


Now let me simplify the Card header icon to remove the gradient: 

Let me create a more comprehensive update to the file. Let me read the current state and make a complete replacement: 

Let me read the current file to see exactly what's there now: 

Now I can see the issue - the header still has the gradient. Let me fix all the headers at once: 

Let me use a different approach and update the icon color mapping directly at the platform definition level. Let me create a simple script to replace all at once: 
```

```


Good! Now let's do the same for the Marketing and Portal Berita cards. Let me continue with the Marketing card: 
```

```


Now let me update the Portal Berita and default platform cards to complete the theme update: 
```

```


Now let me update the default platform card (for UnifiTV, ASTRO, RTMKlik) and the metrics grid: 
```

```


Now let me also update the "No Data" state to match the clean theme: 
```

```


Perfect! Now the Multiplatform page should have the same clean, professional theme as the SocMedAcc and Dashboard pages. Let me summarize all the theme changes I've made:
