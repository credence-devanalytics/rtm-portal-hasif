# Changing header border color to solid black (2025-10-13 08:01Z)

make the border of the header black

I'll help you make the border of the header black. Looking at the code, I can see the border color is currently set to `border-black/20` (20% opacity black) and `border-black/10` (10% opacity black) depending on the scroll state. I'll change both to solid black. 
```

```
Perfect! I've updated the header to have a solid black border. The changes I made:

1. Added `border-b` to ensure the bottom border is applied
2. Changed `border-black/20` to `border-black` (for scrolled state)
3. Changed `border-black/10` to `border-black` (for default state)

Now the header will have a solid black bottom border instead of the semi-transparent versions, making it much more visible and defined.

change the background colour gray

I'll help you change the background color to gray. Let me first check the current state of the file to see what edits were made. Now I'll change the background color from white to gray. I'll update both the scrolled and non-scrolled states: 
```

```
Perfect! I've changed the header background color to gray. The changes I made:

1. **Non-scrolled state**: Changed from `bg-white/10` to `bg-gray-100/80` (light gray with 80% opacity)
2. **Scrolled state**: Changed from `bg-white/20` to `bg-gray-200/90` (slightly darker gray with 90% opacity)

The header now has a gray background with a subtle darkening effect when you scroll down the page, while maintaining the backdrop blur effect for a modern look.
