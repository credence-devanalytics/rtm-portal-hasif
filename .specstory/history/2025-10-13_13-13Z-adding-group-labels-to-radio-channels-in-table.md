I'll help you add group labels/tags to the radio channels in the RTMMediaTable. First, let me check what the radio channel groups are from your database query.

Based on your query, it seems you have 4 groups for radio channels. Let me search for more context about these groups in your workspace. Great! I can see the radio channel groups. Let me check the actual group definitions: Perfect! Now I can see that the radio channels are grouped into 4 categories:
1. **Radio Nasional** (FM Stations)
2. **Radio Daerah** (Regional FM)
3. **Radio Musik** (Music Stations)
4. **Radio Klasik** (Specialty Radio)

Let me update the RTMMediaTable component to add group tags for each radio channel: 
```

```
Now let's update the table row to display the group tag for radio channels: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully updated the RTMMediaTable component to display group tags for radio channels. Here's what I added:

## Changes Made:

1. **Added Radio Channel Groups Mapping**: Created a `radioChannelGroups` object that maps the 4 radio groups to their respective channels:
   - **Radio Nasional** (National Radio): NASIONALfm, MUTIARAfm, Aifm
   - **Radio Daerah** (Regional Radio): JOHORfm, KEDAHfm, KELANTANfm, SABAHfm, PERAKfm, etc.
   - **Radio Musik** (Music Radio): TRAXXfm, ASYIKfm
   - **Radio Klasik** (Classic Radio): RADIO KLASIK, MINNALfm, SPPR

2. **Created a Helper Function**: `getRadioChannelGroup()` function that returns the group name for any given radio channel.

3. **Updated Table Display**: Modified the table row rendering to:
   - Check if the current tab is "radio"
   - Get the group tag for each radio channel
   - Display a colored badge next to the channel name with distinct colors:
     - ðŸ”µ **Blue** for Radio Nasional
     - ðŸŸ¢ **Green** for Radio Daerah
     - ðŸŸ£ **Purple** for Radio Musik
     - ðŸŸ  **Orange** for Radio Klasik

The tags will only appear when viewing the "Radio" tab, and each channel will be labeled with its appropriate group. The badges use Tailwind CSS classes for styling and are color-coded for easy visual distinction.

create a button to click to order by total posts, by total reach, total interactions, and groupname (only for radio).

I'll add sorting buttons to the table headers that allow sorting by Total Posts, Total Reach, Total Interactions, and Group Name (for radio channels only). Let me update the component: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added sorting functionality to the RTMMediaTable component. Here's what I implemented:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Added New Icons**
- Imported `ArrowUpDown`, `ArrowUp`, and `ArrowDown` from lucide-react for sorting indicators

### 2. **Added Sorting State**
- `sortBy`: Tracks which column is being sorted ('posts', 'reach', 'interactions', 'groupname')
- `sortOrder`: Tracks the sort direction ('asc' or 'desc')

### 3. **Added Sort Handler**
- `handleSort()`: Toggles between ascending/descending when clicking the same column, or sets a new sort column

### 4. **Updated Data Processing**
- Added `groupName` property to each row for radio channels
- Implemented sorting logic that works for all sort types
- Sorting is applied before the "show top 5" filter for radio channels
- Sorting resets when switching tabs

### 5. **Interactive Column Headers**
Each header now has clickable sort buttons with:
- **Total Posts**: Sort by number of posts
- **Total Reach**: Sort by reach metrics
- **Total Interactions**: Sort by interaction metrics
- **Group Name** (Radio tab only): Sort by radio group name (Radio Nasional, Radio Daerah, Radio Musik, Radio Klasik)

### 6. **Visual Indicators**
- **Gray up/down arrows** (ArrowUpDown): Column is not sorted
- **Dark up arrow** (ArrowUp): Sorted ascending
- **Dark down arrow** (ArrowDown): Sorted descending
- Hover effects on all sort buttons

### Features:
âœ… Click any column header to sort by that metric  
âœ… Click again to reverse the sort order  
âœ… Group Name sorting only appears on the Radio tab  
âœ… Visual feedback shows which column is sorted and in what direction  
âœ… Sorting persists when showing more/less radio channels  
âœ… Sorting resets when switching between tabs  
âœ… Default sort is descending (highest to lowest)

The sorting works seamlessly with your existing group tags, so you can now sort radio channels by their group names to see all "Radio Nasional" channels together, all "Radio Daerah" channels together, etc.!
