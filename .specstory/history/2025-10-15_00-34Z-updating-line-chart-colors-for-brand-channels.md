I'll update the channel colors in the `channelColors` object to match the brand colors you specified. 
```

Perfect! I've updated the channel colors in the line chart to use your brand colors:

- **TV1**: #122F86 (dark blue)
- **TV2**: #FF5A08 (orange)
- **TV OKEY/OKEY**: #FDD302 (yellow)
- **BERITA RTM**: #FD0001 (red)
- **SUKAN RTM**: #9FA1A3 (gray)
- **TV6**: #EA1F7D (pink)
- **BERNAMA**: #1F2023 (dark gray/black)

The colors will now be applied to both the "Reach Over Time" and "Rating Over Time" line charts. I've included both "TV OKEY" and "OKEY" entries to ensure the color applies correctly regardless of how the channel name appears in the data.
