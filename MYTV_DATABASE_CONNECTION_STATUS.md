# MyTV Viewership Page - Database Connection Summary

## ✅ Status: Already Connected to Database!

The MyTV Viewership page **is already linked to the real database** and working correctly!

## What Was The Problem?

The page was showing "No data" because:
- **Default filter was set to year `2025`**
- **Database has no data for year 2025**
- The API was correctly filtering by year=2025, found 0 records, and returned empty result

### Evidence from Server Logs:
```
MyTV Viewership API - Request params: {
  page: 1,
  limit: 50,
  sortBy: 'viewers',
  sortOrder: 'desc',
  year: '2025',    ← Filtering by 2025
  ...
}
Fetching data from database with 1 conditions
Fetched 0 records from database    ← Database query successful, but no 2025 data
No data found in database with current filters
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changed Default Year Filter:
```typescript
// Before:
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  year: "2025",  // ❌ No data for 2025
  ...
});

// After:
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  year: "all",   // ✅ Show all years
  ...
});
```

### Added "All Years" Option:
- Added "All Years" option to the year dropdown
- Expanded available years: `["2024", "2025", "2023", "2022"]`
- Updated reset function to default to "all"

## How The Database Connection Works

### 1. Frontend (page.tsx)
```typescript
// Fetches data from API
const response = await fetch(`/api/mytv-viewership?${params}`);
```

### 2. API Route (/api/mytv-viewership/route.ts)
```typescript
// Connects to database using Drizzle ORM
let query = db.select().from(mytvViewership);
if (whereConditions.length > 0) {
  query = query.where(and(...whereConditions));
}
const allData = await query;  // ← Real database query
```

### 3. Database (mytv_viewership table)
- Database: `rtmmedina` at `202.165.14.216`
- Table: `mytv_viewership`
- Connection: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- Status: ✅ **Connected and Working**

## Data Flow

```
User → MyTV Page → /api/mytv-viewership → Database → Response → Charts/Tables
         (React)      (Next.js API)      (PostgreSQL)   (JSON)   (Display)
```

## Current Configuration

### Filters Available:
| Filter | Options | Default |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Year | All Years, 2024, 2025, 2023, 2022 | **All Years** ✅ |
| Channel | All Channels, TV1, TV2, OKEY, etc. | All Channels |
| Region | All Regions, KL, Selangor, etc. | All Regions |
| Sort By | viewers, year, channel | viewers |
| Sort Order | asc, desc | desc |

### API Features Working:
- ✅ Database queries via Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Filtering by year, channel, region
- ✅ Sorting and pagination
- ✅ Aggregations (channel breakdown, regional breakdown, monthly trends)
- ✅ Error handling with detailed logging

## What Data Will Now Display

After refreshing the page, you should see:
- All records from the database (all years combined)
- Channel breakdown across all years
- Regional distribution
- Monthly trends
- Summary statistics

## To View Specific Year Data

Users can now:
1. Select specific year from dropdown (2024, 2023, 2022, etc.)
2. Click "Apply" to filter
3. View data for that year only
4. Click "Reset" to go back to all years

## Testing Steps

1. **Refresh the browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Page should now load with data (all years)
3. Try filtering by specific year (2024, 2023, etc.)
4. Check charts and tables populate correctly

## Database Query Example

When page loads with "All Years":
```sql
SELECT * FROM mytv_viewership
ORDER BY viewers DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

When filtered by year 2024:
```sql
SELECT * FROM mytv_viewership
WHERE year = 2024
ORDER BY viewers DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
